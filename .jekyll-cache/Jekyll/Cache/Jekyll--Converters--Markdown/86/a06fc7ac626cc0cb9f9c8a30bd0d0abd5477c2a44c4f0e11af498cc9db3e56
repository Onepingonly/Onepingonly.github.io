I"Ş<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Today, Iâ€™m going to venture from discussion of mere fact and offer some of my own thoughts and opinions on a type of warship surrounded with controversy: the battlecruiser. As many of you are aware, the British Royal Navy lost three of these majestic warships at the Battle of Jutland in 1916: the <em>Indefatigable</em>, <em>Queen Mary</em>, and <em>Invincible</em> (with Rear Admiral Horace Hood aboard) all blew up with almost no survivors. Years later, in 1941, the HMS <em>Hood</em>, Britainâ€™s last and most advanced battlecruiser, was lost in the Battle of the Denmark Straitâ€“blowing up just as violently as her predecessors lost at Jutland. Something was evidently wrong with these â€œbloodyâ€ ships.</p>
