title: "On Battlecruisers"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I’m going to venture from discussion of mere fact and offer some of my own thoughts on a type of warship surrounded with controversy: the battlecruiser. As many of you are aware, the British Royal Navy lost three of these majestic warships at the Battle of Jutland in 1916: The *Indefatigable*, *Queen Mary*, and *Invincible* (with Rear Admiral Horace Hood aboard) all blew up with almost no survivors. Years later, in 1941, the HMS *Hood*,Britain’s last and most advanced battlecruiser, was lost in the Battle of the Denmark Strait--blowing up just as violently as her predecessors sunk at Jutland. Something was evidently wrong with these “bloody” ships.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, many have concluded that the loss of these four vessels irrefutably demonstrated that the concept of the battlecruiser was unsound. In my opinion, this is a misleading conclusion--the heavy losses sustained by the British at Jutland can much more accurately be attributed to the manner in which the ships were deployed and handled, rather than to any inherent flaws in the designs (of which there were many). Nonetheless, the battlecruiser, with the armor of a cruiser but the guns and engines of a dreadnought battleship, was inherently unfit to serve in the line of battle, and the concept that these vessels could join into the line of battle after spotting the enemy fleet and reporting its position to the main body of their force was, without a doubt, problematic. But, without going into too much detail, allow me to pose a different argument. Let’s suppose that the battlecruiser was the perfect warship for the protection of British commerce across the globe--that there was no financially better option. In *Royal Navy battlecruiser vs. High Seas Fleet battlecruiser*, naval historian Mark Stille argues that the capital required for the British to procure a single battlecruiser could have been much better spent on a larger number of smaller cruisers. I would like to provide a different perspective.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the 19th century, the Royal Navy’s numerical and qualitative superiority was unquestionable; the French, realizing they could never defeat the British in a major fleet engagement, decided to invest in the construction of a large number of armored cruisers which, in the event of war with Great Britain, could harass British commerce across the globe, crippling their economy. However, with the advent of the steam turbine, the age of the armored cruiser was coming to an end--it was now possible (albeit at great expense) to build a ship with the speed of a cruiser and the armament of a dreadnought battleship, although armor would have to be sacrificed to conserve weight. This class, the battlecruiser, would theoretically be able to outgun anything it couldn’t outrun (although as stated previously, this makes little sense in a line of battle or against other battlecruisers), and rendered all armored cruisers obsolete; the ability of the battlecruiser to intercept and destroy armored cruisers was amply demonstrated when *Invincible* and *Inflexible* sank *Scharnhorst* and *Gneisenau* at the Falklands in 1914. No standard cruiser could have performed the task as well.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, was the battlecruiser concept a sound one, and were they worth the investment? Yes, and no. The battlecruiser was extremely effective at destroying enemy cruisers, and while used in this role would only be put at serious risk if used in battle against another vessel of its type. However, which nations besides for Germany and the United States could actually afford to build and operate a sizeable fleet of battlecruisers? Although much has been written on the superiority of German battlecruisers to their British counterparts, and they proved quite useful in the major fleet actions of the war (Dogger Bank, Jutland), there was little or nothing they could do to prevent the British battlecruisers from operating with impunity across the globe, for they could not sail around the English Isles or through the English Channel into the North Sea without risking interception and annihilation by the Grand Fleet under Admiral Jellicoe. Thus, I would posit that the battlecruiser was, at least in theory, quite a useful asset for the British Royal Navy prior to and during the First World War.
