As many of you are aware, the British Royal Navy lost three of these majestic warships at the Battle of Jutland in 1916: the &lt;em&gt;Indefatigable&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Queen Mary&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Invincible&lt;/em&gt; (with Rear Admiral Horace Hood aboard) all blew up with almost no survivors. Years later, in 1941, the HMS &lt;em&gt;Hood&lt;/em&gt;, Britain’s last and most advanced battlecruiser, was lost in the Battle of the Denmark Strait–blowing up just as violently as her predecessors lost at Jutland. Something was evidently wrong with these “bloody” ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Images/965f69df2d96456252426c2f89f2f006.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The battlecruiser HMS &lt;em&gt;Hood&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;      However, many have concluded that the loss of these four vessels irrefutably demonstrated that the concept of the battlecruiser was unsound. In my opinion, this is a misleading conclusion–the heavy losses sustained by the British at Jutland can much more accurately be attributed to the manner in which the ships were deployed and handled, rather than to any inherent flaws in the designs (of which there were many). Nonetheless, the battlecruiser, with the armor of a cruiser but the guns and engines of a dreadnought battleship, was inherently unfit to serve in the line of battle, and the concept that these vessels could join into the line of battle after spotting the enemy fleet and reporting its position to the main body of their force was, without a doubt, problematic. But, without going into too much detail, allow me to pose a different argument. Let’s suppose that the battlecruiser was the perfect warship for the protection of British commerce across the globe–that there was no financially better option. In &lt;em&gt;Royal Navy battlecruiser vs. High Seas Fleet battlecruiser&lt;/em&gt;, naval historian Mark Stille argues that the capital required for the British to procure a single battlecruiser could have been much better spent on a larger number of smaller cruisers. I would like to provide a different perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Images/NewZealand1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Indefatigable class battlecruiser &lt;em&gt;New Zealand&lt;/em&gt;, present at Jutland.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;      At the end of the 19th century, the Royal Navy’s numerical and qualitative superiority was unquestionable; the French, realizing they could never defeat the British in a major fleet engagement, decided to invest in the construction of a large number of armored cruisers which, in the event of war with Great Britain, could harass British commerce across the globe, crippling their economy. However, with the advent of the steam turbine, the age of the armored cruiser was coming to an end–it was now possible (albeit at great expense) to build a ship with the speed of a cruiser and the armament of a dreadnought battleship, although armor would have to be sacrificed to conserve weight. This class, the battlecruiser, would theoretically be able to outgun anything it couldn’t outrun (although as stated previously, this makes little sense in a line of battle or against other battlecruisers), and rendered all armored cruisers obsolete; the ability of the battlecruiser to intercept and destroy armored cruisers was amply demonstrated when &lt;em&gt;Invincible&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Inflexible&lt;/em&gt; sank &lt;em&gt;Scharnhorst&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Gneisenau&lt;/em&gt; at the Falklands in 1914. No standard cruiser could have performed the task as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Images/Derfflinger2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The German battlecruiser &lt;em&gt;Derfflinger&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;      So, was the battlecruiser concept a sound one, and were they worth the investment? Yes, and no. The battlecruiser was extremely effective at destroying enemy cruisers, and while used in this role would only be put at serious risk if used in battle against another vessel of its type. However, which nations besides for Germany and the United States could actually afford to build and operate a sizeable fleet of battlecruisers? Although much has been written on the superiority of German battlecruisers to their British counterparts, and they proved quite useful in the major fleet actions of the war (Dogger Bank, Jutland), there was little or nothing they could do to prevent the British battlecruisers from operating with impunity across the globe, for they could not sail around the English Isles or through the English Channel into the North Sea without risking interception and annihilation by the Grand Fleet under Admiral Jellicoe. Thus, I would posit that the battlecruiser was, at least in theory, quite a useful asset for the British Royal Navy prior to and during the First World War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Decades later, the U.S. Navy would build two “large cruisers” (designated CB) of the &lt;em&gt;Alaska&lt;/em&gt; class, which, designed to outgun any existing cruiser and outrun battleships, were battlecruisers in all but name.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">      Today, I’m going to venture from discussion of mere fact and offer some of my own thoughts and opinions on a type of warship surrounded with controversy: the battlecruiser.

&lt;p&gt;                On this day in 1941, just three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese land-based aircraft sank the Renown class battlecruiser &lt;em&gt;Repulse&lt;/em&gt; and King George V class battleship &lt;em&gt;Prince of Wales&lt;/em&gt; in the South-China Sea. While the men of Force Z fought valiantly to repel the Japanese aircraft and avoid their torpedoes and bombs, both capital ships ultimately succumbed to the aerial onslaught, with hundreds of casualties; even worse, of eighty-eight Japanese aircraft involved in the attack, only four were destroyed (using figured from Wikipedia). Somewhat ironically, this triumph of aircraft over some of the Royal Navy’s best capital ships was just as, if not more troublesome to the Japanese than the British. While the British were evidently shocked that a modern battleship and modernized battlecruiser had been sunk in open ocean by aircraft (even worse in their eyes, by Japanese pilots), the victory had serious implications for Japan’s naval strategy and tactics. Had the IJN not just spent the prior decade designing and building the largest, most-powerfully armed and best-protected class of fast-battleships in the world? With the explicit intent of giving the IJN the decisive edge in the decisive battle they planned to fight against the American battle line, which at best they could attrit through airstrikes? Did the sinking of Repulse and Prince of Wales, capable warships of the British Empire, not imply the same fate could befall the ships of the Yamato class? I am currently reading John Toland’s &lt;em&gt;The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire, 1936-45&lt;/em&gt;, in which the events of 10 December, 1941, are described in great detail; with the above questions in mind, I find it extraordinarily interesting to consider the effects of this action on the Japanese Naval leadership. While not as well known in the United States as the events of December 7, I think the attack on Force Z on December 10, 1941, and the courage displayed by the men involved, are deserving of our remembrance.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
